# DeepStream Python Object Detection Requirements

# PyGObject - Python bindings for GObject-based libraries
# Provides access to GStreamer and GstRtspServer
# Note: These are typically pre-installed in the DeepStream container
# If running outside the container, install with:
#   sudo apt-get install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-3.0
#   sudo apt-get install gir1.2-gst-rtsp-server-1.0

# No additional Python packages required - everything is included in DeepStream container
